# LAURA - FULL-STACK CHALLENGE

## Introduction

Welcome to LAURA's Full-Stack Challenge.

The primary goal of this exercise is to evaluate your ability to create a well-defined architecture, using the latest patterns and technologies to reach the goal of the challenge. There's no hard rules or tricky questions.

**We hope you have fun.**

If you are not a developer, you can have a look at our other opportunities at [laura-br.gupy.io](https://laura-br.gupy.io/)

## About Us

Laura is a Cognitive Robot Risk Manager that operates integrated with data environments to collect, organize and ultimately perform complex calculations, compare results with probabilistic ranges and accurately conclude whether or not conditions are favourable for a risk event occurs.

## About The Challenge

You will have 5 days to deliver this challenge, but be aware that we will more rigorously evaluate your code the longer it takes to deliver from the date this repository was forked.

For this exercise, you need to build a fast, realtime chat application. You will have to develop as it is on the preview below:

You have to develop all features presented (chat, rooms, project tasks), also you are expected to implement a login/sign up feature.

## Screens

The screen provided is the expected final design. However, you are also expected to implement a user interface on the login/sign up screen and the responsiveness by yourself.

**You don't have to worry about animation.**

## Technology

Because the purpose of this exercise is to evaluate your architectural and backend skills, you can use any structure or library provided it is in the following languages:

### Backend

- Python
- Node.JS

### Frontend

- React

### Database

- PostgreSQL
- MongoDB

## Bonus Points

- Documentation in code
- API documentation (e.g. Swagger)
- Small files with few responsibilities
- Use some preprocessor for your CSS, preferably SASS
- Follow some Style Guide
- Componentization
- Unit/Component Test
- Usage of Docker

## Review

After you delivered the completed assignment to us, we will review it as soon as we can. **We pay special attention to:**

- Coding skills

- - Writing understandable code
  - Whether you use HTML, JavaScript and CSS properly

- Software Engineering Skills

- - Code organization (modularity, dependencies between modules, naming, etc)

- Overall Feeling

- - Software usability
  - Assignment completion
  - Overall code quality (edge cases, usage of tools, performance, best practices)

## Ready to start the challenge?

- Fork this repository into your GitHub account
- Create a branch with your first and last name ex: `patrick-santos`
- After completing the challenge, create a pull request in this repository comparing your branch with the master
- Upload the system on [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), so we can test with multiple users aat the same time
-  We will receive notification of your pull request, evaluate your solution, and contact the GitHub account email where the challenge was run
